# Multiplayer
Multiplayer looks the same as single player. The maps are multiplayer specific. Players use the same computer with one gamepad each.
One player controls the protagonist while the other controls the facility (doors, moving platforms).
The multiplayer game is not split screen. It looks almost identical to the single player.
The player that controls the facility and the player that controls the protagonist switch after each level.
